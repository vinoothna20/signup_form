# Signup Form

## Project Overview
This is a simple **Signup Form** created as part of my learning project. It includes basic form elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and password fields. The form also uses **HTML5 browser validation** to ensure that users fill in the correct information before submission.

### Features
- **Form fields**:
  - First Name and Last Name (Text inputs)
  - Email Address (Text input with validation)
  - Age (Number input with a minimum value)
  - Password (Password input with validation for strength)
  - Terms and Conditions (Checkbox with validation)
- **Browser Validation**:
  - HTML5 validation attributes such as `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `pattern`.
  - Built-in validation for fields like email and password.

### What I Learned
- **Different Types of Forms**:
  - Text Inputs: For entering names, email, etc.
  - Password Fields: For securely entering passwords.
  - Number Inputs: For age or other numerical data.
  - Password (Password input with validation for strength)
  - Checkboxes: To agree to terms and conditions.
- **Browser Validation**:
  - I used HTML5 validation attributes like `required`, `minlength`, and `maxlength` to ensure that the form is filled out correctly before submission.
  - The browser automatically validates fields based on attributes like `required` and `pattern`.
- **Styling Forms**:
  - I styled the form using CSS, applying properties like `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and background colors to improve the form’s appearance and user experience.
